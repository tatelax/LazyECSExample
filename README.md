# LazyECSExample
 This is an example project for LazyECS.

# SimulationController

In this example project, you will find a class called MainSimulationController which implements SimulationController.

A SimulationController is just one example of how you might "kick off" your LazyECS Worlds and thus the rest of your ECS features, systems, and so on.

One advantage to this approach is it provides a single entry point into the rest of your codebase.
